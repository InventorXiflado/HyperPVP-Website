CHANGELOG - Paintball PVP

21-08-2013;

- Fixed users couldn't break blocks. Due to moving servers I accidently left the spawn radius to 16 when it should have been 0.

22-08-2013;

- Added a spawn protection timer for FFA maps consisting of 8 seconds.

23-08-2013;

- Added anti-combat logging.
- Fixed Destroy The Monument blocks not logging that the person actually removed all the blocks.
- Added a new spawn hub. If users wish to see a match without joining they can type /spectate
- Added a new command called /hub. This works if you're in or not in a game. Teleports you back to spawn hub.

24-08-2013;

- Combat log didn't actually log a kill.
